Finding Strong Gravitational Lenses in the DESI DECam Legacy Survey

We have performed a semi-automated search for strong gravitational lensing systems in the 9,000 deg2 Dark Energy Camera Legacy Surveys (DECaLS), part of the DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys. We adopted the deep residual neural network architecture developed by Lanusse et al.. We compiled a training sample that consists of observed non-lenses and known lensing systems. In this paper we present 335 candidate strong lensing systems, identified for the first time.
