Finding Strong Gravitational Lenses in the DESI DECam Legacy Survey

We have performed a semi-automated search for strong gravitational lensing systems in the 9,000 deg2 Dark Energy Camera Legacy Surveys (DECaLS), part of the DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys. We adopted the deep residual neural network architecture developed by Lanusse et al.. We compiled a training sample that consists of observed non-lenses and known lensing systems. In this paper we present 335 candidate strong lensing systems, identified for the first time.

Discovering New Strong Gravitational Lenses in the DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys

We search in the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument Legacy Imaging Surveys for new strong lensing systems by using deep residual neural networks, building on previous work presented in Huang et al. After applying our trained neural networks to the survey data, we visually inspect and rank images with probabilities above a threshold. Here we present 1014 new strong lens candidates.
